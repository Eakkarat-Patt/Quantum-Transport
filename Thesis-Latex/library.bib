abstract = {We investigate present some new statistical properties of order books. We analyse data from the Nasdaq and investigate (a) the statistics of incoming limit order prices, (b) the shape of the average order book, and (c) the typical life time of a limit order as a function of the distance from the best price. We also determine the 'price impact' function using French and British stocks, and find a logarithmic, rather than a power-law, dependence of the price response on the volume. The weak time dependence of the response function shows that the impact is, surprisingly, quasi-permanent, and suggests that trading itself is interpreted by the market as new information. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Recently, a new "type-II" Weyl fermion, which exhibits exotic phenomena, such as an angle-dependent chiral anomaly, was discovered in a new phase of matter where electron and hole pockets contact at isolated Weyl points [Nature (London) 527, 495 (2015)NATUAS0028-083610.1038/nature15768]. This raises an interesting question about whether its counterpart, i.e., a type-II Dirac fermion, exists in real materials. Here, we predict the existence of symmetry-protected type-II Dirac fermions in a class of transition metal dichalcogenide materials. Our first-principles calculations on PtSe2 reveal its bulk type-II Dirac fermions which are characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, novel surface states, and exotic doping-driven Lifshitz transition. Our results show that the existence of type-II Dirac fermions in PtSe2-type materials is closely related to its structural P3-m1 symmetry, which provides useful guidance for the experimental realization of type-II Dirac fermions and intriguing physical properties distinct from those of the standard Dirac fermions known before.},

abstract = {Valley current, a stable, dissipationless current, originates due to the emergence of Berry curvature in inversion symmetry broken systems. Several theoretical predictions and experimental observations have explored layer symmetry breaking in AB-stacked bilayer graphene due to long-range Coulomb interactions between the electrons. However, none of the experimental studies conducted so far have observed valley current in unbiased bilayer graphene, which makes it vital to study the Berry curvature in unbiased bilayer graphene. In this study, we observed a non-zero Berry curvature with opposite values at K and K′ valleys, validating the argumentation of the asymmetry persistent in unbiased bilayer graphene. The magnitude, as well as the polarity of the Berry curvature, is tunable with the application of an out-of-plane electric field. These results are especially important because they can lead to the realization of a valley valve, in which the carriers from the K and K′ valleys can be regulated with a gate at the centre of a bilayer graphene nanoribbon.},

abstract = {The extraordinary electronic properties of Dirac materials, the two-dimensional partners of Weyl semimetals, arise from the linear crossings in their band structure. When the dispersion around the Dirac points is tilted, one can predict the emergence of intricate transport phenomena such as modified Klein tunneling, intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, and ferrimagnetism. However, Dirac materials are rare, particularly with tilted Dirac cones. Recently, artificial materials whose building blocks present orbital degrees of freedom have appeared as promising candidates for the engineering of exotic Dirac dispersions. Here we take advantage of the orbital structure of photonic resonators arranged in a honeycomb lattice to implement photonic lattices with semi-Dirac, tilted, and, most interestingly, type-III Dirac cones that combine flat and linear dispersions. Type-III Dirac cones emerge from the touching of a flat and a parabolic band when synthetic photonic strain is introduced in the lattice, and they possess a nontrivial topological charge. This photonic realization provides a recipe for the synthesis of orbital Dirac matter with unconventional transport properties and, in combination with polariton nonlinearities, opens the way to study Dirac superfluids in topological landscapes.},

abstract = {We derive analytic expressions for the critical temperatures of the superconducting (SC) and pseudogap (PG) transitions of the high-Tc cuprates as a function of doping. These are in excellent agreement with the experimental data both for single-layered materials such as LSCO, Bi2201 and Hg1201 and multi-layered ones, such as Bi2212, Bi2223, Hg1212 and Hg1223. Optimal doping occurs when the chemical potential vanishes, thus leading to an universal expression for the optimal SC transition temperatures. This allows for the obtainment of a quantitative description of the growth of such temperatures with the number of layers, N, which accurately applies to the Bi, Hg and Tl families of cuprates. We study the pressure dependence of the SC transition temperatures, obtaining excellent agreement with the experimental data for different materials and dopings. These results are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian for the itinerant oxygen holes, which includes both the electric repulsion between them and their magnetic interactions with the localized copper ions. We show that the former interaction is responsible for the SC and the latter, for the PG phases, the phase diagram of cuprates resulting from the competition of both. The Hamiltonian is defined on a bipartite oxygen lattice, which results from the fact that only the px and py oxygen orbitals alternatively hybridize with the 3d copper orbitals. From this, we can provide an unified explanation for the dx2−y2 symmetry of both the SC and PG order parameters and obtain the Fermi pockets observed in ARPES experiments.},

abstract = {The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junction (n-p-n or p-n-p) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Precise spatial control over the electrical properties of thin films is the key capability enabling the production of modern integrated circuitry. Although recent advances in chemical vapour deposition methods have enabled the large-scale production of both intrinsic and doped graphene, as well as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), controlled fabrication of lateral heterostructures in these truly atomically thin systems has not been achieved. Graphene/h-BN interfaces are of particular interest, because it is known that areas of different atomic compositions may coexist within continuous atomically thin films and that, with proper control, the bandgap and magnetic properties can be precisely engineered. However, previously reported approaches for controlling these interfaces have fundamental limitations and cannot be easily integrated with conventional lithography. Here we report a versatile and scalable process, which we call patterned regrowth, that allows for the spatially controlled synthesis of lateral junctions between electrically conductive graphene and insulating h-BN, as well as between intrinsic and substitutionally doped graphene. We demonstrate that the resulting films form mechanically continuous sheets across these heterojunctions. Conductance measurements confirm laterally insulating behaviour for h-BN regions, while the electrical behaviour of both doped and undoped graphene sheets maintain excellent properties, with low sheet resistances and high carrier mobilities. Our results represent an important step towards developing atomically thin integrated circuitry and enable the fabrication of electrically isolated active and passive elements embedded in continuous, one-atom-thick sheets, which could be manipulated and stacked to form complex devices at the ultimate thickness limit. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) boron (that is, borophene) was recently synthesized following theoretical predictions1–5. Its metallic nature and high in-plane anisotropy combine many of the desirable attributes of graphene6 and monolayer black phosphorus7. As a synthetic 2D material, its structural properties cannot be deduced from bulk boron, which implies that the intrinsic defects of borophene remain unexplored. Here we investigate borophene line defects at the atomic scale with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Under suitable growth conditions, borophene phases that correspond to the v1/6 and v1/5 models are found to intermix and accommodate line defects in each other with structures that match the constituent units of the other phase. These line defects energetically favour spatially periodic self-assembly that gives rise to new borophene phases, which ultimately blurs the distinction between borophene crystals and defects. This phenomenon is unique to borophene as a result of its high in-plane anisotropy and energetically and structurally similar polymorphs. Low-temperature measurements further reveal subtle electronic features that are consistent with a charge density wave (CDW), which are modulated by line defects. This atomic-level understanding is likely to inform ongoing efforts to devise and realize applications based on borophene.},

In less symmetric Dirac materials possessing anisotropic cones with tilted axes, the Coulomb interaction can provide still more exotic phenomena, which have not been experimentally unveiled yet. Here, using site-selective nuclear magnetic resonance, we find a non-uniform cone reshaping accompanied by a bandwidth reduction and an emergent ferrimagnetism in tilted Dirac cones that appear on the verge of charge ordering in an organic compound. Our theoretical analyses based on the renormalization-group approach and the Hubbard model show that these observations are the direct consequences of the long-range and short-range parts of the Coulomb interaction, respectively. The cone reshaping and the bandwidth renormalization, as well as the magnetic behaviour revealed here, can be ubiquitous and vital for many Dirac materials.},

The observed Dirac cones are actually formed by the pz orbitals of one of the inequivalent sublattices composed of uniquely four atoms, yielding an underlying hexagonal network topologically equivalent to distorted graphene. A significant physical outcome of this effect includes the possibility of converting metallic 8-Pmmn borophene into an indirect band gap semiconductor by means of external shear stress. The stability of the strained structures are supported by a phonon frequency analysis. The Dirac cones are sensitive to the formation of vacancies only in the inequivalent sublattice electronically active at the Fermi level.},

abstract = {The potential of graphene for carbon electronics rests on the possibilities offered by its unusual band structure to create devices that have no analogue in silicon-based electronics. Conduction and valence bands in graphene form conically shaped valleys, touching at a point called the Dirac point. There are two inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, related by time-reversal symmetry. Intervalley scattering is suppressed in pure samples. The independence and degeneracy of the valley degree of freedom suggests that it might be used to control an electronic device, in much the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronics or quantum computing. A key ingredient for 'valleytronics' would be a controllable way of occupying a single valley in graphene, thereby producing a valley polarization. Here we propose such a valley filter, based on a ballistic point contact with zigzag edges. The polarity can be inverted by local application of a gate voltage to the point contact region. Two valley filters in series may function as an electrostatically controlled valley valve, representing a zero-magnetic-field counterpart to the familiar spin valve. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed great advancements in the science and engineering of systems with unconventional band structures, seeded by studies of graphene and topological insulators. While the band structure of graphene simulates massless relativistic electrons in two dimensions, topological insulators have bands that wind non-trivially over momentum space in a certain abstract sense. Over the last couple of years, enthusiasm has been burgeoning in another unconventional and topological (although, not quite in the same sense as topological insulators) phase - the Weyl semimetal. In this phase, electrons mimic Weyl fermions that are well known in high-energy physics, and inherit many of their properties, including an apparent violation of charge conservation known as the chiral anomaly. In this review, we recap some of the unusual transport properties of Weyl semimetals discussed in the literature so far, focusing on signatures whose roots lie in the anomaly. We also mention several proposed realizations of this phase in condensed matter systems, since they were what arguably precipitated activity on Weyl semimetals in the first place. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* ≈ 106 m s -1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

The Weyl fermions correspond to isolated points of bulk band degeneracy, Weyl nodes, which are connected only through the crystal's boundary by exotic Fermi arcs. The length of the Fermi arc gives a measure of the topological strength, because the only way to destroy the Weyl nodes is to annihilate them in pairs in the reciprocal space. To date, Weyl semimetals are only realized in the TaAs class. Here, we propose a tunable Weyl state in MoxW1-xTe2 where Weyl nodes are formed by touching points between metallic pockets. We show that the Fermi arc length can be changed as a function of Mo concentration, thus tuning the topological strength.

For that, many researchers have investigated the doped graphene which is effective to tailor its electronic property and chemical reactivity. This work presents a review of the various graphene doping methods and their device applications. As doping methods, direct synthesis method and post treatment method could be categorized. Because the latter case has been widely investigated and used in various electronic applications, we will focus on the post treatment method. Post treatment method could be further classified into wet and dry doping methods. In the case of wet doping, acid treatment, metal chloride, and organic material coating are the methods used to functionalize graphene by using dip-coating, spin coating, etc. Electron charge transfer achieved from graphene to dopants or from dopants to graphene makes p-type or n-type graphenes, respectively, with sheet resistance reduction effect. In the case of dry doping, it can be further categorized into electrostatic field method, evaporation method, thermal treatment method, plasma treatment method, etc. These doping techniques modify Fermi energy level of graphene and functionalize the property of graphene. Finally, some perspectives and device applications of doped graphene are also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Scientific Publishers.},

The results show that the effect of asymmetry of the double Fermi-velocity barrier structures, the difference value between $\xi$1 and $\xi$2 cause of the oscillations the spin-dependent quantum beating pattern. Which the beating patterns of the spin transport appeared as a result of the superposition of the two oscillatory components in the double Fermi velocity barriers. In addition, we found that the shifting of the spin-dependent quantum beats of the G↑ and G↓ is due to the presence of the exchange field, H, that is, the G↑ and G↓ are shifted in the opposite direction. By the difference value of the phase shift can be estimated to be 2H. In case of U+$\eta$$\sigma$H{\textgreater}{\textgreater}EF which electrons are collimated, the oscillations behaviors show the quantum beating with holding constant amplitude and the period of the beating amplitude depend on the Fermi velocity ratio mismatch in FG regions. These interesting characteristic of spin-dependent quantum transport may identify the effect of Femi-velocity asymmetry on double proximity-induced ferromagnetic graphene structure for making spintronic devices.},

abstract = {The groundbreaking works in graphene and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) over the past decade, and the very recent discovery of borophene naturally draw attention to the yet-to-be-explored borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). We herein report a density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic and magnetic properties of BNRs. The foci are the impact of orientation (denoted as BxNRs and ByNRs with their respective periodic orientations along x- and y-axis), ribbon width (Nx, Ny=4–15), and hydrogenation effects on the geometric, electronic and magnetic properties of BNRs. We found that the anisotropic quasi-planar geometric structure of BNR and the edge states largely govern its electronic and magnetic properties. In particular, pristine ByNRs adopt a magnetic ground state, either anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) depending on the ribbon width, while pristine BxNRs are non-magnetic (NM). Upon hydrogenation, all BNRs exhibit NM. Interestingly, both pristine and hydrogenated ByNRs undergo a metal-semiconductor-metal transition at Ny=7, while all BxNRs remain metallic.},

abstract = {The influence of magnetic vector potential barrier (MVPB) on the spin-polarized transport of massless Dirac particles in ferromagnetic graphene is studied theoretically. The phenomenon of Klein tunneling of relativistic particles across a rectangular potential barrier prevents any of the massless fermions from being confined but they can be electrically confined by quantum dots with integrable dynamics (Bardarson et al., 2009) [36]. Utilization of only the in-plane exchange splitting in the ferromagnetic graphene cannot produce 100{\%} spin polarization. This tunneling can be confined using the magnetic vector potential barrier, which leads to high degree of spin polarization. By combining the orbital effect and the Zeeman interaction in graphene junction, it is found that the junction mimics behavior of half-metallic tunneling junction, in which it acts as a metal to particles of one spin orientation but as an insulator or a semiconductor to those of the opposite orientation. The idea of the half-metallic tunneling junction can provide a source of ∼100{\%} spin-polarized current, which is potentially very useful. Adjustment of the position of the Fermi level in ferromagnetic layer by placing a gate voltage on top of the ferromagnetic layer shows that reverse of the orientation of the completely spin-polarized current passing through the junction is controlled by adjusting the gate voltage. These interesting characteristics should lead to a practical gate voltage controlled spin filtering and spin-polarized switching devices as a perfect spin-polarized electron source for graphene-based spintronics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{MERTON1975,
abstract = {A common hypothesis about the behavior of limited liability asset prices in perfect markets is the random walk of returns or in its continuous-time form the geometric Brownian motion hypothesis, which implies that asset prices are stationary and log-normally distributed. A number of investigators of the behavior of stock and commodity prices have questioned the accuracy of the hypothesis. In an earlier study described in the chapter, it was examined that the continuous-time consumption-portfolio problem for an individual whose income is generated by capital gains on investments in assets with prices assumed to satisfy the “geometric Brownian motion” hypothesis. Under the additional assumption of a constant relative or constant absolute risk-aversion utility function, explicit solutions for the optimal consumption and portfolio rules were derived. The changes in these optimal rules with respect to shifts in various parameters such as expected return, interest rates, and risk were examined by the technique of comparative statics. This chapter presents an extension of these results for more general utility functions, price behavior assumptions, and income generated also from noncapital gains sources. If the geometric Brownian motion hypothesis is accepted, then a general separation or mutual fund theorem can be proved such that, in this model, the classical Tobin mean-variance rules hold without the objectionable assumptions of quadratic utility or of normality of distributions for prices. Hence, when asset prices are generated by a geometric Brownian motion, the two-asset case can be worked on without loss of generality.},

Although Lorentz invariance is required in high energy physics, it is not necessarily obeyed in condensed matter physics, and thus Lorentz-violating type-II Weyl/Dirac fermions could be realized in topological semimetals. The recent realization of type-II Weyl fermions raises the question whether their spin-degenerate counterpart-type-II Dirac fermions-can be experimentally realized too. Here, we report the experimental evidence of type-II Dirac fermions in bulk stoichiometric PtTe 2 single crystal. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first-principles calculations reveal a pair of strongly tilted Dirac cones along the $\Gamma$-A direction, confirming PtTe 2 as a type-II Dirac semimetal. Our results provide opportunities for investigating novel quantum phenomena (e.g., anisotropic magneto-transport) and topological phase transition.},

abstract = {We examine applying a trend following methodology to global asset allocation between equities, bonds, commodities and real estate. This strategy offers substantial improvement in risk-adjusted performance compared to buy-and-hold portfolios and a superior method of asset allocation than risk parity. We believe the discipline of trend following overcomes many of the behavioural biases investors succumb to, such as regret and herding, and offers a solution to the inappropriate sequence of returns which can be problematic for decumulation portfolios. The other side of behavioural biases is that they may be exploited by investors: an example is momentum investing where herding leads to continuation of returns and has been identified across many assets. Momentum and trend following differ as the former is a relative concept and the latter absolute. Combining both can achieve the higher return levels associated with momentum portfolios with much reduced volatility and drawdowns due to trend following. Measures based on utility of a representative investor reinforce the superiority of combining trend following with momentum strategies. These techniques help address the sequencing of returns issue which can be a serious issue for financial planning.},

Spin and valley polarizations are almost linearly dependent on biased voltage near zero bias and then turn into perfect switch at biased voltage approaching the superconducting gap. The perfect switching of large magnetoresistance has been also predicted at biased energy near the superconducting gap.

abstract = {The world's first two-dimensional material, known as graphene, has captured the attention of scientists and researchers worldwide due to its many useful and surprising properties such as its controllable optical transparency, immense strength and high mobility at room temperature [1]. Widespread applications have already been discovered for the novel material such as membrane technology, energy storage, sensors and nanoelectronics, with many more to be found in the future. In recent years, research has developed in the concept of using graphene in nanodevices for applications in computation memory and storage, however this requires the use of geometries small enough that considering a graphene sheet as infinite is no longer valid. By considering finite width graphene systems, which are called nanoribbons, it will be found that new properties emerge as a direct consequence of the fact the geometry is finite, namely the existence of " edge states " . These edge states are of great interest as they have the potential to be used in spintronic applications due to the presence of spin-dependant currents [2]. As well as this, graphene nanoribbons can be chosen to be either an electronically conducting or insulating material depending on the width of the ribbon itself, however this does introduce issues with producing a sample of graphene with specific properties in the laboratory, but this will not be discussed here. If finite graphene ribbons are to be used in nano-electronic devices, it also becomes apparent that the behaviour of graphene needs to be understood at both in finite-sized system but also in the presence of a general magnetic field, for which there are many papers in the literature [3,4,5]. In this report, the electronic properties of both infinite and finite graphene systems will be investigated by use of the tight-binding model of the electrons on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. This will be used to derive the energy band structures for both infinite and finite systems by diagonalising the relevant Hamiltonian via both analytical methods and numerical analysis where applicable. These methods will then be extended to developing the theory for both systems of graphene when in the presence of a magnetic field, where the behaviour of the edge states will be further explored.},

abstract = {Klein tunneling refers to the absence of normal backscattering of electrons even under the case of high potential barriers. At the barrier interface, the perfect matching of electron and hole wavefunctions enables a unit transmission probability for normally incident electrons. It is theoretically and experimentally well understood in two-dimensional relativistic materials such as graphene. Here we investigate the Klein tunneling effect in Weyl semimetals under the influence of magnetic field induced by ferromagnetic stripes placed at barrier boundaries. Our results show that the resonance of Fermi wave vector at specific barrier lengths gives rise to perfect transmission rings, i.e., three-dimensional analogue of the so-called magic transmission angles in two-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Besides, the transmission profile can be shifted by application of magnetic field in the central region, a property which may be utilized in electro-optic applications. When the applied potential is close to the Fermi level, a particular incident vector can be selected by tuning the magnetic field, thus enabling highly selective transmission of electrons in the bulk of Weyl semimetals. Our analytical and numerical calculations obtained by considering Dirac electrons in three regions and using experimentally feasible parameters can pave the way for relativistic tunneling applications in Weyl semimetals.},

The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system.

This is achieved by introducing a special set of graphynelike exchange bonds by means of which the complete spectrum of the underlying Weyl Hamiltonian can be realized. Our ab initio calculations demonstrate a unique class of eigensolutions corresponding to a type-II class of Dirac fermionic excitations. Based on our approach, one can systematically synthesize a wide range of strongly anisotropic band diagrams having tilted Dirac cones with variable location and orientation. Moreover, we show that asymmetric conical diffraction, as well as edge states, can arise in these configurations.

abstract = {Vertical integration of two-dimensional materials has recently emerged as an exciting method for the design of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. Using density functional theory, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of two heterostructures, graphene/phosphorene (G/BP) and hexagonal boron nitride/phosphorene (BN/BP). We found that the interlayer distance, binding energy, and charge transfer in G/BP and BN/BP are similar. Interlayer noncovalent bonding is predicted due to the weak coupling between the p{\textless}inf{\textgreater}z{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}orbital of BP and the {\$}\pi{\$} orbital of graphene and BN. A small amount of electron transfer from graphene and BN, scaling with the vertical strain, renders BP slightly n-doped for both heterostructures. Several attractive characteristics of BP, including direct band gap and linear dichroism, are preserved. However, a large redistribution of electrostatic potential across the interface is observed, which may significantly renormalize the carrier dynamics and affect the excitonic behavior of BP. Our work suggests that graphene and BN can be used not only as an effective capping layer to protect BP from its structural and chemical degradation while still maintaining its major electronic characteristics but also as an active layer to tune the carrier dynamics and optical properties of BP.},

When a finite B-field is applied, transmission of the normally incident electrons is suppressed in MLG over an energy range around the PN barrier height, effectively opening an energy gap. This suppression may be attributed to the magnetic deflection arising from Lorentz force, which shifts the transmission profile of the device in the transverse direction. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

We emphasize the connection to related phenomena in optics, such as the Snell-Descartes law of refraction, total internal reflection, Fabry-P{\$}\backslash{\$}'erot resonances, negative refraction index materials (the so called meta-materials), etc. We also stress that Klein tunneling is not a genuine quantum tunneling effect as it does not necessarily involve passing through a classically forbidden region via evanescent waves. A crucial role in Klein tunneling is played by the conservation of (sublattice) pseudo-spin, which is discussed in detail. A major consequence is the absence of backscattering at normal incidence, of which we give a new shorten proof. The current experimental status is also thoroughly reviewed. The appendix contains the discussion of a one-dimensional toy model that clearly illustrates the difference in Klein tunneling between mono- and bi-layer graphene.},

Here, we propose that both type-I and type-II Dirac fermions can exist in the graphene embedding nitrogen line defects, and the types of Dirac fermions can be tuned by the size W of graphene nanoribbons between the line defects. By comparison of the two types of Dirac fermions, their different physical properties and originations are revealed directly. Remarkably, the type-I Dirac points induce one Fermi arc corresponding to edge states along the armchair direction, while the type-II Dirac points induce two Fermi arcs corresponding to two sets of edge states along the zigzag direction. These results not only expand our views on the Dirac fermions in two-dimensional structures but also extend their applications in electronics.},

Here, motivated by the emergence of novel Dirac materials, we investigate the propagation behaviors of anisotropic MDFs in such a p-n junction structure. By projecting the Hamiltonian of the anisotropic MDF to that of the isotropic MDF and deriving an exact analytical expression for the propagator, precise Veselago focusing is demonstrated without the need for mirror symmetry of the electron source and its focusing image. We show a tunable focusing position that can be used in a device to probe masked atom-scale defects. This study provides an innovative concept to realize Veselago focusing relevant for potential applications, and it paves the way for the design of novel electron optics devices by exploiting the anisotropic MDF.},

Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals - materials hosting Weyl fermions - were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe 2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe 2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.},

This Fermi velocity is roughly one order of magnitude larger than the largest velocity ever reported in 2D organic Dirac materials, and it is comparable to that in graphene.

STM images show 1-D and 2-D periodic super-lattices originating from the functionalization of a single sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene structure. Field-dependent super-lattices in 3-nm wide ''zigzag'' nanoribbons indicate local moments with parallel and anti-parallel ordering along and across the edges, respectively. Anti-parallel ordering is observed in 2-D segments with sizes of over 20 nm.

The critical temperature and superconducting gap both have spikes in the transition point as functions of the tilt parameter of the Dirac cone determined, in turn, by the material parameters like pressure. The spectrum of superconducting excitations is different in two phases: The sharp cone pinnacle is characteristic for type I, while two parallel almost flat bands, are formed in type II.

Here, we show that HgTe and half-Heusler compounds, under a broad range of in-plane compressive strain, could be materials in nature realizing ideal Weyl semimetals with four pairs of Weyl nodes and topological surface Fermi arcs. Generically, we find that the HgTe-class materials with nontrivial band inversion and noncentrosymmetry provide a promising arena to realize ideal Weyl semimetals. Such ideal Weyl semimetals could further provide a unique platform to study emergent phenomena such as the interplay between ideal Weyl fermions and superconductivity in the half-Heusler compound LaPtBi.},

Experimentally identifying and characterizing new functional two-dimensional materials is challenging, but also potentially rewarding.

Reliable transistor performance is achieved at room temperature in samples thinner than 7.5 nm, with drain current modulation on the order of 10 5 and well-developed current saturation in the I-V characteristics. The charge-carrier mobility is found to be thickness-dependent, with the highest values up to 1/41,000 cm 2 V 1 s 1 obtained for a thickness of 1/410 nm.

abstract = {We evaluate the transmission through magnetic barriers in graphene-based nanostructures. Several particular cases are considered: a magnetic step, single and double barriers, and $\delta$ -function barriers. A separate class of magnetic-barrier structures are those with inhomogeneous magnetic-field profiles, such that the average magnetic field vanishes, which can be realized by nanostructured ferromagnetic stripes placed on top of the graphene layer. Quantum bound states that are localized near or in the barrier are predicted for a magnetic step and some structures with finite-width barriers but none for $\delta$ -function barriers. When a bound state is localized close to the barrier edge, it has a nonzero velocity parallel to this edge. The transmission depends strongly on the direction of the incident electron or hole wave vector and gives the possibility to construct a direction-dependent wave vector filter. In general, the resonant structure of the transmission is significantly more pronounced for (Dirac) electrons with linear spectrum than for the usual electrons with a parabolic spectrum. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

The crucial influences of this effect on material properties and its incorporation into the continuum model have received widespread attention in the past half century. Here we predict the existence of a different effect due to the hopping of the electron across an atomically sharp interface. For a general lattice, its influence on transport could be equally important as the energy band nonparabolicity/anisotropy, but cannot be incorporated into the continuum model. On the honeycomb lattice of graphene, it leads to the breakdown of the conventional Klein tunneling -- one of the exotic phenomena of relativistic particles -- and the onset of tilted Klein tunneling. This works identifies a unique feature of the discrete atomic lattice for transport, which is relevant for ballistic electronic devices at high carrier densities.},

We use the generalized scattering approach to calculate the spin current in normal-ferromagnetic-normal (N-F-N) junction of the materials. The tilting of the Dirac cone strongly influence the transport properties and hence the spin conductance. We find a reversal of spin current polarization with smooth variation of the tilt parameter. We also study the spin current by the adiabatic precession of a doped ferromagnet on top of the material. It is shown that spin-mixing conductance and hence spin current become zero for a finite value of tilt. These findings provide an efficient way towards high controllability of spin transport of the ferromagnetic junction and can be very useful in the field of spintronics. Depending on the character of spin transport properties, it is also possible to measure the tilt of the Dirac cone. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

Picking up prepatterned hBN flakes to be used as a gate dielectric or mask for other 2D materials opens new possibilities for the design and fabrication of 2D heterostructures. In this Letter, we demonstrate this technique in two ways: first, a dual-gated graphene device that is encapsulated between an hBN substrate and prepatterned hBN strips. The conductance of the graphene device shows pronounced Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot oscillations as a function of carrier density, which implies strong quantum confinement and ballistic transport in the locally gated region. Second, we describe a WSe2 device encapsulated in hBN with the top hBN patterned as a mask for the channel of a Hall bar. Ionic liquid selectively tunes the carrier density of the contact region of the device, while the hBN mask allows independent tunability of the contact region for low contact resistance. Hall mobility larger than 600 cm2/(V{\textperiodcentered}s) for few-layer p-type WSe2 at 220 K is measured, the highest mobility of a thin WSe2 device reported to date. The observations of ballistic transport in graphene and high mobility in WSe2 confirm pick-up of prepatterned hBN as a versatile technique to fabricate ultraclean devices with high quality contact.},

Establishing triangular or hexagonal symmetry, from periodically patterned molecule assembly or electrostatic gating as well as from moir{\'{e}} pattern induced by substrate, has produced electronic states with linear dispersions from two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) residing in semiconductors, metals, and graphene. Different from the commonly studied isotropic host systems, here we demonstrate that massless Dirac fermions with tunable anisotropic characteristics can, in general, be generated in highly anisotropic 2DEG under slowly varying external periodic potentials. In the case of patterned few-layer black phosphorus superlattices, the new chiral quasiparticles exist exclusively in certain isolated energy window and inherit the strong anisotropic properties of pristine black phosphorus. These states exhibit asymmetric Klein tunneling, in which the transmission probability of the wave packets with normal incidence is no longer unity and can be tuned and controlled. In general, the direction of wave packet incidence for perfect transmission and that of the normal incidence are different, and the difference can reach more than 50° under an appropriate barrier orientation in black phosphorus superlattices. Our findings provide insight into the understanding and possible utilization of these novel emergent chiral quasiparticles.},

Such Bragg reflectors can be used to make resonant cavities. We also analyze the associated band structure for the case of infinite periodic structures. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In this work, we adopt first-principles calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the potential of borophene as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. It is found that borophene has an adsorption energy to lithium atom of -1.12 eV, which is large enough to ensure a good lithium-borophene stability during the lithiation process. The fully lithiated phase of borophene is Li0.75B, corresponding to a theoretical specific capacity of 1860 mA h g-1, which is about 4 times larger than that of the commercial graphite anode (372 mA h g-1). More excitingly, it is found that the energy barrier along the furrow of corrugated borophene is only 2.6 meV, which is much lower than those of other widely investigated anode materials such as phosphorene (80 meV) and Ti3C2 (70 meV). The finding suggests that lithium diffusion on borophene can be extremely fast. In the meantime, a strong directional anisotropy is observed for lithium diffusion, with a 325.1 meV barrier perpendicular to the furrow of borophene. This phenomenon is further proved by ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K and the result shows the lithium atom can freely drift along the furrow, but seldom jumps to the neighboring furrows. Finally, borophene is found to exhibit metallic characteristics during the whole lithiation process, indicating that the material has an excellent electronic conductivity. The findings reported in this work suggest that borophene, as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, has potential to drastically boost batteries' energy density and power density.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been employed to investigate the possibility of 2D boron sheets (BSs) as an anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Among $\alpha$, $\alpha$1 and $\eta$4/28 metallic BSs, planarity is retained for the $\alpha$1 and $\eta$4/28 polymorphs after the formation of the layered structure. The optimum anodic nature of the $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$1-AA polymorphs has been suggested based on their electronic, structural and Li adsorption/desorption studies. The highly symmetric 'H' site is energetically favored for Li adsorption at both 0 and 298 K. Li migration occurs from one 'H' site to another via the top of a boron atom, with a 0.66 and 0.39 eV energy barrier at 0 and 298 K respectively. An increase in the lithium concentration, up to a 50{\%} coverage of 'H' sites, decreases the diffusion barrier gradually and reaches the saturation point at 0.59 eV (at 0 K). The lithium saturation requires eight lithium atoms per 1.63 nm2 surface area of the $\alpha$1 sheet, when all 'H' sites become occupied. This confers the theoretical estimate of the capacity as 383 mA h g-1, which is higher than that of the conventional graphitic electrode. Finally, the structural stability at the lithium saturation point is confirmed by increasing the number of layers up to four. All of these characteristics suggest the appropriateness of $\alpha$1-AA as an anode material for LIBs. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The voltage on the first gate is used to shift the Fermi level in the FG layer. Enhancement of the on/off conductance ratio on the switching is shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the second gate barrier. We show that by biasing the nanostructures with the voltage U2, the spin polarization can be increased and that as a consequence, the thickness of the FG barrier layer needed for spin-polarized transport can be reduced. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Williams2017,
abstract = {Quantum materials offer the opportunity to investigate electronic behavior beyond electron-like excitations, and graphene is (from an electrical perspective) our highest-quality quantum material. Its honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms produces a gapless, linear energy dispersion, and electron mobility can now reach values near 1,000,000 cm2/V s [1-3]. Aside from reaching mobility near the best two-dimensional semiconductor materials, its energy dispersion allows for novel device phenomena, enhancing device capabilities beyond electronics based on conventional material electrical devices. Within a few years of isolating single-layer graphene, several groups developed methods to create adjacent p (hole-like) and n (electron-like) regions within a single sheet of graphene [4-6] (Fig. 8.1). Around the same time, the role of disorder on charge transport at low carrier densities was understood to be dominated by puddles of electrons and holes [7, 8]. Hence, this junction is essential to many electrical properties of graphene, and a thorough understanding of the role the p-n interface plays in electron transport is essential. Small devices, where the mean-free path is of the order of or greater than the device size, enable the investigation of optics-like phenomena using electrons rather than photons. For example, focusing on ballistic electrons using an electrostatic lens has been demonstrated in GaAs two-dimensional electron gases [9, 10]. However, in typical semiconductors, only carriers of the same sign of electrical charge are allowed in adjacent regions - carriers of a different sign are separated by an insulating space where the Fermi energy transitions through the band gap. For gapless materials such as graphene, carriers are allowed to switch sides at the interface; electrons can be transmitted or scattered as holes (and vice versa). From this come new phenomena, augmenting the optics-like phenomena available to electrons. Further, the relative immunity of the mean-free path to temperature in graphene [11] allows some of the novel optical phenomena in graphene to persist to high temperatures ({\textgreater}100 K). In this chapter, I will survey the current status of research in graphene p-n junctions. In Section 8.2, the basic theory of electrical transport through a single p-n interface at B = 0 and B {\textgreater} 0 (B is the magnetic field) will be described. Section 8.3 will review three aspects of the optical-like phenomena capable in graphene: Veselago lensing, confinement and guiding, and snake states. Recent experimental progress in this area will be detailed.},

Graphene naturally lacks this band gap unless it undergoes certain modifications. Kim et al. studied the electronic structure of black phosphorus—a related two-dimensional material. By sprinkling potassium atoms on top of single layers of black phosphorus, the material changed from being a semiconductor to having a gapless linear dispersion similar to that of graphene.Science, this issue p. 723Black phosphorus consists of stacked layers of phosphorene, a two-dimensional semiconductor with promising device characteristics. We report the realization of a widely tunable band gap in few-layer black phosphorus doped with potassium using an in situ surface doping technique. Through band structure measurements and calculations, we demonstrate that a vertical electric field from dopants modulates the band gap, owing to the giant Stark effect, and tunes the material from a moderate-gap semiconductor to a band-inverted semimetal. At the critical field of this band inversion, the material becomes a Dirac semimetal with anisotropic dispersion, linear in armchair and quadratic in zigzag directions. The tunable band structure of black phosphorus may allow great flexibility in design and optimization of electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {The shift of Dirac point in graphene devices is of great importance, influencing the reliability and stability. Previous studies show the Dirac point shifts slightly to be more positive when the drain bias increases. Here, an abnormal shift of Dirac point is observed in monolayer graphene field effect transistors by investigating the transfer curves under various drain biases. The voltage of Dirac point shifts positively at first and then decreases rapidly when the channel electric field exceeds some threshold. The negative Dirac point shift is attributed to holes injection into oxide layer and captured by the oxide traps under high channel electric field. This can also be demonstrated through a simple probability model and the graphene Raman spectra before and after theDCmeasurement.},

Analytical results are directly derived from transfer matrix constituted by the parametric controls, which range to the incoming energy, incident angle, width and strength of the potential barriers. Referring to the analytical analysis and numerical simulations, the transmission and conductance resonances effected by the double potential barrier can be clearly obtained and understood. Specially, modulations of the chiral tunneling show that resonant oscillations emerge in serial high incident energies, and platforms of low transmission probability come into existence due to propagations of the imaginary wave vectors.},

This coupling can be regulated with quantum confinement in semiconductor heterostructures through band-structure engineering. Here we investigate the spin Hall effect 3 , 4 and current-induced spin polarization 5 , 6 in a two-dimensional electron gas confined in (110) AlGaAs quantum wells using Kerr rotation microscopy. In contrast to previous measurements 7-10 , the spin Hall profile shows complex structure and the current-induced spin polarization is out-of-plane. The experiments map the strong dependence of the current-induced spin polarization to the crystal axis along which the electric field is applied, reflecting the anisotropy of the spin-orbit interaction. These results reveal opportunities for tuning a spin source using quantum confinement and device engineering in non-magneticmaterials.},

Bottom-up fabricated atomically-precise segmented graphene nanoribbons, SGNRs, open avenues for studies of electrical transport, coherence, and interference effects in metallic, semiconducting, and mixed GNRs, with different edge terminations. Conceptual and practical understanding of electric transport through SGNRs is gained through nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) conductance calculations and a Dirac continuum model that absorbs the valence-to-conductance energy gaps as position-dependent masses, including topological-in-origin mass-barriers at the contacts between segments. The continuum model reproduces the NEGF results, including optical Dirac Fabry-Prot (FP) equidistant oscillations for massless relativistic carriers in metallic armchair SGNRs, and an unequally-spaced FP pattern for mixed armchair-zigzag SGNRs where carriers transit from a relativistic (armchair) to a nonrelativistic (zigzag) regime. This provides a unifying framework for analysis of coherent transport phenomena and interpretation of forthcoming experiments in SGNRs.},

Following the suggestions in Glosten and Jagannathan (1994), this article shows how to model hedge fund returns by focusing on the popular "trend-following" strategy. We use lookback straddles to model trend-following strategies, and show that they can explain trend-following funds' returns better than standard asset indices. Though standard straddles lead to similar empirical results, lookback straddles are theoretically closer to the concept of trend following. Our model should be useful in the design of performance benchmarks for trend-following funds.},

abstract = {Recent explosion of interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials research has led to extensive exploration of physical and chemical phenomena unique to this new class of materials and their technological potential. Atomically thin layers of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 and WSe2 are remarkably stable semiconductors that allow highly efficient electrostatic control due to their 2D nature. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D TMDs are basic building blocks for novel electronic and chemical sensing applications. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of TMD-based FETs and summarize the current understanding of interface and surface effects that play a major role in these systems. We discuss how controlled doping is key to tailoring the electrical response of these materials and realizing high performance devices. The first part of this review focuses on some fundamental features of gate-modulated charge transport in 2D TMDs. We critically evaluate the role of surfaces and interfaces based on the data reported in the literature and explain the observed discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical values of carrier mobility. The second part introduces various non-covalent strategies for achieving desired doping in these systems. Gas sensors based on charge transfer doping and electrostatic stabilization are introduced to highlight progress in this direction. We conclude the review with an outlook on the realization of tailored TMD-based field-effect devices through surface and interface chemistry.},

We review the different physical means of generating pseudo-fields, the observable consequences of pseudo-fields and their similarities to and differences from electromagnetic fields.

abstract = {Few-layer black phosphorus is a semiconductor material, where its allotrope is called phosphorene; a new two-dimensional material which is discovered in 2014. In this paper, first we use the tight-binding method to implement a matrix representation for single-layer and multilayer structures of phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) to define the Hamiltonian of the system. Second, we investigate the band structure and the band gap of multilayer PNRs. The band gap of armchair PNRs with 16 atoms across the width of PNR for single-layer, bilayer, and three-layer structures are obtained as 1.899, 1.224, and 0.937 eV, respectively. Third, we use the atomistic description of structure to simulate the performance characteristics of single and multilayer PNR field effect transistors (PNRFETs) by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Based on the properties of the material and device structures, Id-Vgs, Id-Vds characteristics, energy band diagram in the channel, and ION/IOFF are analyzed. The ON to OFF current ratio for single-layer, bilayer, and three-layer PNRFETs are increasing when the channel length increases from 5 nm to 15 nm. The current ratio for single-layer increases from 1277 for Lch=5 nm to 216.7×106 for Lch=15 nm. The ION/IOFF in single-layer PNRFET is higher in comparison with those values in bilayer and three-layer PNRFETs due to very small off-current in the single-layer PNRFET which in turn resulted from its larger band gap. The results show that the performance of PNRFET changes significantly depending on the number of phosphorene layers and the length of the channel of device.},

In addition we verified the direction dependence of the electronic current in two perpendicular directions, namely, Ix and Iy; where for both systems, we found a current ratio, $\eta$ = Ix/Iy, of around 2. Aiming to control such a current anisotropy, $\eta$, we performed a study of its dependence with respect to an external strain. Where, by stretching the borophane sheet, $\eta$ increases by 11{\%} for a bias voltage of 50 mV.},

abstract = {In this work, electrical properties and application for volatile organic compounds detection of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)−graphene (MS/G) heterostructure is investigated. The MS/G heterostructure is synthesized by physical stacking of single-layer (SL) MoS2 over SL graphene. The difference in the work-functions between the MoS2 and graphene leads to electron transfer from MoS2 to graphene, which changes FET charge neutrality point (VCNP) of graphene by as much as 30 V and increases the electron-to-hole ratio in graphene. This charge transport phenomenon is further confirmed by shifting of Raman G peak and quenching of photoluminescence intensity by 50{\%} of MoS2 in the heterostructure. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a 0.1 eV upshift of the Fermi level of graphene in MS/G, which is consistent with the electrical double-layer capacitance versus the electrode potential measurement and energy band alignment predicted by first-principle simulations. The heterogenity induced charge transfer in the heterostructure of MS/G results in outstanding performance in chemical sensing. The MS/G FET shows improved stability in dry air with negligible shifting of VCNP, as compared to graphene FET. In the detection of toluene, the MS/G FET-based sensor shows higher sensitivity and superior signal-to-noise ratio compared to MoS2 or graphene individually.},

abstract = {We study the phonon-limited mobility in intrinsic n-type single-layer MoS 2 for temperatures T 100 K. The materials properties including the electron-phonon interaction are calculated from first principles and the deformation potentials and Fr{\"{o}}hlich interaction in single-layer MoS 2 are established. The calculated room-temperature mobility of ∼410 cm2V -1s -1 is found to be dominated by optical phonon scattering via intra and intervalley deformation potential couplings and the Fr{\"{o}}hlich interaction. The mobility is weakly dependent on the carrier density and follows a $\mu$∼T -$\gamma$ temperature dependence with $\gamma$=1.69 at room temperature. It is shown that a quenching of the characteristic homopolar mode, which is likely to occur in top-gated samples, increases the mobility with ∼70 cm2V -1s -1 and can be observed as a decrease in the exponent to $\gamma$=1.52. In comparison to recent experimental findings for the mobility in single-layer MoS 2 (∼200 cm2V -1s -1), our results indicate that mobilities close to the intrinsic phonon-limited mobility can be achieved in two-dimensional materials via dielectric engineering that effectively screens static Coulomb scattering on, e.g., charged impurities. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

However, boron cannot form graphene-like structures with a honeycomb hexagonal framework because of its electron deficiency. Computational studies suggest that extended boron sheets with partially filled hexagonal holes are stable; however, there has been no experimental evidence for such atom-thin boron nanostructures. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that B 36 is a highly stable quasiplanar boron cluster with a central hexagonal hole, providing the first experimental evidence that single-atom layer boron sheets with hexagonal vacancies are potentially viable. Photoelectron spectroscopy of B 36 - reveals a relatively simple spectrum, suggesting a symmetric cluster. Global minimum searches for B 36 - lead to a quasiplanar structure with a central hexagonal hole. Neutral B 36 is the smallest boron cluster to have sixfold symmetry and a perfect hexagonal vacancy, and it can be viewed as a potential basis for extended two-dimensional boron sheets. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, by using first-principles methods, we predict that the recently reported borophene (2D boron sheets) can serve as an ideal electrode material with high electrochemical performance for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The calculations are performed on two experimentally stable borophene structures, namely $\beta$12 and $\chi$3 structures. The optimized Li and Na adsorption sites are identified, and the host materials are found to maintain good electric conductivity before and after adsorption. Besides advantages including small diffusion barriers and low average open-circuit voltages, most remarkably, the storage capacity can be as high as 1984 mA h g-1 in $\beta$12 borophene and 1240 mA h g-1 in $\chi$3 borophene for both Li and Na, which are several times higher than the commercial graphite electrode and are the highest among all the 2D materials discovered to date. Our results highly support that borophenes can be appealing anode materials for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries with extremely high power density.},

Vertical transport measurements across the WSe2/EG heterostructure provides evidence that an additional barrier to carrier transport beyond the expected WSe2/EG band offset exists due to the interlayer gap, which is supported by theoretical local density of states (LDOS) calculations using self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF).},

The desired valley current can transmit with zero reflection while the electrons from the other valley are totally reflected. Thus, the system generates pure valley-polarized current with maximum conductance.

Spin and valley polarizations are almost linearly dependent on biased voltage near zero bias and then turn into perfect switch at biased voltage approaching the superconducting gap. The perfect switching of large magnetoresistance has been also predicted at biased energy near the superconducting gap.

For the tunneling through periodic square-shaped magnetic barriers, the transmission is angular $\phi$ asymmetry, and the asymmetrical transmission probability becomes more pronounced with increasing the superlattice number n. However, the transmission is symmetric with respect to angle $\gamma$, and the window of the transmission become more and more narrower with increasing the number of barriers, i.e., the collimator behavior. This feature comes from the electron Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot modes among the barriers. We find that the constructive interference of the backscattering amplitudes suppress transmissions, and consequently form the minigaps of the transmission. The transmission can be switched on/off by tuning the incident energies and angles, the heights and numbers of the magnetic barriers, and result in the interesting collimator behavior.},

This emergent behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems defines the unifying framework for a class of materials we call "Dirac materials." In order to establish this class of materials, we illustrate how Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac fermions have been identified experimentally using electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials shares a significant number of universal properties in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these common properties including nodal points in the excitation spectrum, density of states, specific heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as discuss many-body interaction effects. We further review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is controlled by specific symmetries of the material, such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin-orbit symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their distinct real material background leads to rich novel physics with common fingerprints such as the suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced resonant states. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {In this paper we apply a heuristic method based on artificial neural networks (NN) in order to trace out the efficient frontier associated to the portfolio selection problem. We consider a generalization of the standard Markowitz mean-variance model which includes cardinality and bounding constraints. These constraints ensure the investment in a given number of different assets and limit the amount of capital to be invested in each asset. We present some experimental results obtained with the NN heuristic and we compare them to those obtained with three previous heuristic methods. The portfolio selection problem is an instance from the family of quadratic programming problems when the standard Markowitz mean-variance model is considered. But if this model is generalized to include cardinality and bounding constraints, then the portfolio selection problem becomes a mixed quadratic and integer programming problem. When considering the latter model, there is not any exact algorithm able to solve the portfolio selection problem in an efficient way. The use of heuristic algorithms in this case is imperative. In the past some heuristic methods based mainly on evolutionary algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing have been developed. The purpose of this paper is to consider a particular neural network (NN) model, the Hopfield network, which has been used to solve some other optimisation problems and apply it here to the portfolio selection problem, comparing the new results to those obtained with previous heuristic algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp 2 hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a {\$}\beta{\$} 12 sheet and a 3 sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.},

abstract = {Graphenes conical valence and conduction bands give rise to charge carriers that have neutrino-like linear energy dispersion and exhibit chiral behaviour near the Dirac points where these bands meet. Such characteristics offer exciting opportunities for the occurrence of new phenomena and the development of high performance electronic devices. Making high quality devices from graphene, which typically involves etching it into nanoscale structures, however, has proven challenging. Here we show that a periodic potential applied by suitably patterned modifications or contacts on graphenes surface leads to further unexpected and potentially useful charge carrier behaviour. Owing to their chiral nature, the propagation of charge carriers through such a graphene superlattice is highly anisotropic, and in extreme cases results in group velocities that are reduced to zero in one direction but are unchanged in another. Moreover, we show that the density and type of carrier species (electron, hole or open orbit) in a graphene superlattice are extremely sensitive to the potential applied, and they may further be tuned by varying the Fermi level. As well as addressing fundamental questions about how the chiral massless Dirac fermions of graphene propagate in a periodic potential, our results suggest the possibility of building graphene electronic circuits from appropriately engineered periodic surface patterns, without the need for cutting or etching. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {We investigate the tunneling conductance of Weyl semimetal with tilted energy dispersion by considering electron transmission through a p-n-p junction with one-dimensional electric and magnetic barriers. In the presence of both electric and magnetic barriers, we found that a large conductance gap can be produced with the aid of tilted energy dispersion without a band gap. The origin of this effect is the shift of the electron wave-vector at barrier boundaries caused by (i) the pseudo-magnetic field induced by electrical potential, i.e., a newly discovered feature that is only possible in the materials possessing tilted energy dispersion, (ii) the real magnetic field induced by a ferromagnetic layer deposited on the top of the system. We use a realistic barrier structure applicable in current nanotechnology and analyze the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance. The new approach presented here may resolve a major problem of possible transistor applications in topological semimetals, i.e., the absence of normal backscattering and gapless band structure.},

abstract = {We examine applying a trend following methodology to global asset allocation between equities, bonds, commodities and real estate. This strategy offers substantial improvement in risk-adjusted performance compared to buy-and-hold portfolios and a superior method of asset allocation than risk parity. We believe the discipline of trend following overcomes many of the behavioural biases investors succumb to, such as regret and herding, and offers a solution to the inappropriate sequence of returns which can be problematic for decumulation portfolios. The other side of behavioural biases is that they may be exploited by investors: an example is momentum investing where herding leads to continuation of returns and has been identified across many assets. Momentum and trend following differ as the former is a relative concept and the latter absolute. Combining both can achieve the higher return levels associated with momentum portfolios with much reduced volatility and drawdowns due to trend following. Measures based on utility of a representative investor reinforce the superiority of combining trend following with momentum strategies. These techniques help address the sequencing of returns issue which can be a serious issue for financial planning.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) heteromaterials have aroused a new interest in many applications, and have emerged as a unique family of nanomaterials in physics and materials science. Recently, vertical and in-plane heterostructures of MoS2-WS2 monolayers, were successively prepared and observed in experiments [Gong et al., Nat. Mater., 2014, 13, 1135]. Herein, using a first-principles technique, we study the electronic transport properties of several types of zigzag MoS2-WS2 lateral heterojunctions. The results demonstrate that the MoS2-WS2 lateral heterojunctions show an interesting negative differential resistive (NDR) effect, due to owning very similar band structures to that of the pristine MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons. The electrons always propagate through the heterojunctions along the metal-terminations, while never along the S-termination. The results demonstrate that our proposed transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterojunctions could become candidates of NDR devices, and have potential applications in nanoelectronics.},

Even a dimer composed of two quantum dots exhibits rich physics: Not only the length of the dimer but also its inclination with respect to the incident electron wave vector affect the scattering efficiency, scattering pattern, suppression of Klein tunneling, Fano resonances, vortex pattern, and electron density. A finite cluster with no axis of mirror symmetry aligned with the direction of incident electron exhibits an asymmetric scattering pattern. As a result of deflection of charge carriers to one side of a finite sample, a transverse voltage may be generated. Our results suggest that not only ordered but also disordered clusters of quantum dots can be used to engineer the transport properties of the native graphene.},

For short and wide graphene strips the Fano factor at the Dirac point equals 1/3, 3 times smaller than for a Poisson process.

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac cone materials exhibit linear energy dispersion at the Fermi level, where the effective masses of carriers are very close to zero and the Fermi velocity is ultrahigh, only 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the light velocity. Such Dirac cone materials have great promise in high-performance electronic devices. Herein, we have employed the genetic algorithm methods combined with first-principles calculations to propose a new 2D anisotropic Dirac cone material, an orthorhombic boron phosphide (BP) monolayer named borophosphene. Molecular dynamics simulation and phonon dispersion have been used to evaluate the dynamic and thermal stability of borophosphene. Because of the unique arrangements of B-B and P-P dimers, the mechanical and electronic properties are highly anisotropic. Of great interest is the fact that the Dirac cone of the borophosphene is robust, independent of in-plane biaxial and uniaxial strains, and can also be observed in its one-dimensional zigzag nanoribbons and armchair nanotubes. The Fermi velocities are {\^{a}}{\&}circ;105 m/s, on the same order of magnitude as that of graphene. By using a tight-binding model, the origin of the Dirac cone of borophosphene is analyzed. Moreover, a unique feature of self-doping can be induced by the in-plane biaxial and uniaxial strains of borophosphene and the curvature effect of nanotubes, which is greatly beneficial for realizing high-speed carriers (holes). Our results suggest that the borophosphene holds great promise for high-performance electronic devices, which could promote experimental and theoretical studies for further exploring the potential applications of other 2D Dirac cone sheets.},
