%section 1: Asymmetric tunneling
We start by investigating the tunneling properties of electron across tilted Dirac cone heterojunctions where we focus on how
the effect of the gate potential and tilt affect the electron transmission.  
%section 2: Measure the tilted strength 
%we focused on the tilted parameter $w_0$ since it is the parameter that determines the character of the Dirac cone.
Then, we demonstrate a method to measure the tilted strength of the Dirac cone by identifying the tunneling behavior.
%section 3 Pseudo magnetic field
Finally, we show that the transport behaviors of electron in tilted Dirac cone material are analogous to electron under
the influence of magnetic field. We also show the derivation of magnetic field strength as a function of gate potential and tilted parameter.


%In this study, we assumed that the system is in a condensed state, where the thermal noise can be neglected
\section{Angular dependent of transmission probability} \label{sec:asym}
    The transmission probabilities across the tilted Dirac cone heterojunctions under the variation of gate potential are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:asym}.
    The transmission profiles are symmetric in the case of $w_0 = 0$ regardless of the gate potential. 
    When the tilted parameter is non-zero, the transmission profiles are shifted along the direction of the tilt and consequently become asymmetric, where the magnitude of the shift depends on the tilted strength of the Dirac cone.
    However, the presence of the tilt barely affects the tunneling profiles when the applied gate potential is close to the Fermi energy as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:asym2}.
    This is because the Fermi surface is small and the allowed wavevector states are narrowed. Therefore, electron propagations other than the normal incidence are backscattered.\\
    
    Interestingly, when the applied gate voltage $U$ is larger than the Fermi energy $E_F$, the transmission profiles exhibit peak tunneling as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:asym3}-\subref{fig:asym4}.
    These kind of tunnelings is called resonant tunneling, which occurred when the condition $q_x L = n \pi$, $n = 0, \pm1,...$ in Eq. \ref{eq:tp} is met.
    %In addition, the normal incident perfect tunneling is not affected by the transverse tilted Dirac cone.

\section{The tilted strength identification by means of the tunneling resonance properties} \label{sec:find w}
    The resonant tunnelings are arisen if the given $U, E_F$ and, $w_0$ satisfy the resonance condition.
    Modulating these parameters result in shifting of resonant tunneling angles as previously reported in section \ref{sec:asym}.
    In this section, we demonstrate that by measuring the asymmetric resonant tunneling angles, the tilted parameter can be determined.
    Consider the resonance condition
    %by tracking how much those resonance conditions are shifted
    \begin{align} \label{eq:w0}
        L \sqrt{\left( \frac{E_F-U}{\hbar v_F}+ w_0 k_y \right)^2 -k_y^2} = n \pi \notag\\
        w_{0 \pm} = \frac{U-E_F}{\hbar v_F k \sin{\phi}}\mp \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{n \pi}{k L \sin{\phi}}\right)^2}
    \end{align}
    where subscript $+(-)$ satisfy the positive(negative) angle $\phi$ region.
    One can obtain the tilted parameter by applying the gate voltage and Fermi energy then measure the resonant tunneling angle, which can be experimentally observed
    by four-point probes technique \cite{Rahman2015}.
    To illustrate how to calculate for the tilted parameter, we substitute the configuration of dashed-dotted line in Fig. \ref{fig:asym3} to Eq. \ref{eq:w0}.
    We choose the resonance condition $n=4$, which corresponds to the resonant tunneling angle $\phi = 72^{\circ}$. We find $w_0 = 0.1$.
    Fig. \ref{fig:contour plot} shows the contour plot of transmission probability, where each perfect transmission lines occur due to the different resonance conditions labeled by the integer $n$. 
    These perfect transmission lines can be understood by analyzing Eq. \ref{eq:w0}. 
    The position of perfect transmissions is determined by the term $\sqrt{(1+(n \pi)^2/(k_y L)^2}$ since different value $n$ give rise to different resonant tunneling conditions. 
    For example, $\phi \approx -\pi/2$ the resonance condition $n=6$ occur for $w_{-} \approx 0.34$, while in the case of $n=7$, the tilted parameter $w_{-} \approx 0.57$. The term $(U-E)/\hbar v_F k_y$ is invariant under the resonance condition, therefore it is constant with different value $n$. 
    This term determines the resonant tunneling profile and is responsible for distinctly different behaviors of resonance conditions $n=5$ and 6, where $w_0$ decrease as $\phi$ go toward normal direction.\\

        \label{fig:contour plot}
    \end{figure}

    However, this method is not at all practical since the variable $n$ is unlikely observable.
    Also, the only way to manipulate the electron propagations is by tuning the voltages through the bottom and top gate.
    In section \ref{sec:find w 2}, we propose a more practical method to identify the tilted strength, which again, involve with the resonant tunneling behaviors.

    %When the voltages are applied to the system, there will be 
    %For some given value of $U, E_F, \mathrm{and} $ 
    %resonance condition can be modulated by tuning $U, E_F$ and, $w_0$ since $q_x$ depends on these parameter. 
    %Electron propagations at normal incident undergo the Klein tunneling effect, where the transmission probability always equal to one.
    % the downside of this method is there are unknown parameter such as n
    %In the next section, we show how to get rid of n
\section{Oscillatory behavior of electron resonant tunneling} \label{sec:oscillation}
    To understand the behaviors of resonant tunneling under the effect of the tilt and gate potential, 
    we plot the transmission probabilities at fixed incident angle $\phi = 45^{\circ}$ shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tp 45 deg}.
    We found that the resonant tunneling oscillate with the increasing of gate voltage where the voltage difference between each resonance condition is the same.
    Also The voltages required to satisfy the resonance conditions are increased with the tilted strength.
    These resonant tunnelings are shifted uniformly with the tilted parameter, which can be confirmed mathematically by taking the derivative to Eq. \ref{eq:w0} with respect to $U$
    \begin{align} \label{eq:dw wrt U}
        \frac{d w_{0\pm}}{dU} &= \frac{d}{dU} \left(\frac{U-E_F}{\hbar v_F k \sin{\phi}}\mp \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{n \pi}{k L \sin{\phi}}\right)^2}\right) \notag \\
                              &= \frac{1}{\hbar v_F k \sin{\phi}}.
    \end{align}
    Eq. \ref{eq:dw wrt U} indicates that the tilted parameter is linearly proportional to gate voltage.

\section{Revisit: The tilted strength identification by means of the tunneling resonance properties} \label{sec:find w 2}
    In section \ref{sec:find w}, we have demonstrated a method to identify the character of Dirac cone using the resonant tunneling properties.
    The method can be applied to any resonance condition given that we have known its corresponding resonant tunneling angle.
    However, it is still not a practical method since the parameter $n$ is unobservable.
    Also, most device configurations have fixed angled probes to observe the resonant tunneling current.
    In this section, we revisit this study again and eliminate the drawbacks mentioned above.\\
    
    We have discussed earlier in section \ref{sec:oscillation} that the relation of $w_0$ and $U$ are linear with the slope of $1/\hbar v_F k \sin{\phi}$.
    For this reason, we can identify the tilted strength by measuring the difference between two voltages satisfied the same resonance condition.
    \begin{align} \label{eq:w0 2}
        \Delta w = \frac{\Delta U}{\hbar v_F k_y}.
    \end{align}
    To apply Eq. \ref{eq:w0 2} to determine the tilted parameter, the voltages satisfied the same resonance condition have to be first determined,
    which can be achieved using the device structure depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:3 arms}. We have to tune $U$ until the resonant tunneling occurs at $\phi = \pi/4$,
    where the electron current can be measured as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tp at 45 deg}.
    The voltage at which the resonant tunneling occurs at $\phi = \pi/4$ for the case of non-tilted Dirac cone can be easily obtained since it is the system found in pristine graphene.
    Substituting these gate voltages to Eq. \ref{eq:w0 2} we obtain $w_0 \approx 0.1$, which is the same value as dotted-dashed transmission profile in Fig. \ref{fig:tp at 45 deg}.
    %we can have 
    %we apply the linear relation of $w_0$ and $U$, that we discussed in section \ref{sec:oscillation}, 
    %We can pick any of these resonance condition and find its corresponding gate voltage
    %the tilted parameter can be identified by calculating the voltage difference of that resonance condition

\section{Tilt-induced transverse wavevector shift} \label{sec:pseudo b}
    In section \ref{sec:asym}, we have shown that the tunneling behavior of electron across the tilted Dirac cone exhibits asymmetric transmission. 
    Previously, the transmission of this kind can be achieved by applying the magnetic barrier to the system \cite{RamezaniMasir2008,RamezaniMasir2010}.
    In this section, we demonstrate that the similar transmission profile can also be achieved in the tilted Dirac cone system without the magnetic barrier.
    Consider the x-component wavevector inside the barrier region $q_x = \sqrt{q^2-k_y^2}$, which can be rearranged into the form
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:k_shift}
        q_x \approx \sqrt{q'^2 -(k_y-q'w_0)^2}
    \end{equation} 
    where $q' = \frac{E_F-U}{\eta \hbar v_F}$. 
    Notice that the y-component wavevector in Eq. \ref{eq:k_shift} is shifted by the tilted Dirac cone similar to the wavevector shifted by the effect of magnetic vector potential.
    Based on this analogy, we can derive the equivalent pseudo magnetic field
    \begin{align} \label{eq:pseudo B}
        \frac{\xi}{l_B} &= -q' w_0 \notag \\
        \xi\sqrt{\frac{|e| B}{\hbar}} &=  -\left(\frac{E_F-U}{\eta \hbar v_F}\right) w_0\notag \\
        B &= \left(\frac{\varepsilon w_0}{v_F}\right)^2 \frac{1}{\xi \gamma \hbar |e|}
    \end{align}
    where $\varepsilon = E_F-U$ is effective Fermi energy. 
    $\xi = \pm 1$ is in fact the direction of magnetic field, but since these fields are induced by the tilted Dirac cone, it can be considered as the direction of the tilt.
    The positive(negative) sign mean that the Dirac cone tilted to the left(right) side with respect to normal direction. 
    $\gamma = \pm 1$ indicate the carrier type in Fermi energy level.
    The typical strength of a tilt depends on the material themselves. 
    For example, the DFT calculation results showed the tilted anisotropic Dirac cones in 6,6,12-graphyne with the strength $w_0 \approx 0.2$ \cite{Malko2012,Wang2015b}, 
    which equivalent to the pseudo magnetic field strength $B_s \approx 0.88$ T under the effect of effective Fermi energy $\varepsilon = -120$ meV. 
    Another Dirac material with tilted anisotropic Dirac cones is borophene. The first principle calculation revealed that the tilted parameter of 8-Pmmn borophene $\approx 0.3$ \cite{Cheng2017a}, 
    which can generate the pseudo magnetic field strength $B_s \approx 1.97$ T with $\varepsilon = -120$ meV. 

\section{The pseudo magnetic effect in the tilt-mismatch Dirac cone systems}
    We have found in section \ref{sec:pseudo b} that both the potential and tilt are the source of pseudo-magnetic field effect, where the strength and direction of the field can be controlled by tuning the effective Fermi energy.
    This effect actually been proposed in Weyl semimetal n-p-n junction with tilted Weyl cones \cite{Yesilyurt2017a}.
    However, the coupling of the tilt and top gate potential barrier is required to preserve the effect. In contrast to our work, where the top gate potential can be set to zero, and pseudo-magnetic field effect still occurred according to Eq. \ref{eq:pseudo B}.
    Which is the consequence of the existence of the mismatch between Dirac cones with different tilted parameters. 
    To show how the mismatch plays an important role in mimicking the pseudo-magnetic field effect without the requirement of potential barrier. 
    We sketch the Fermi surface of the first and second regions, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fermi surface}, where top gate potential is set to zero. 
    Hence, electrons in both regions occupy in the same Fermi energy level. 
    If the Dirac cones are tilted homogeneously, the Fermi surface of both regions are completely overlapped. 
    Consequently, the electron can symmetrically propagate in all directions as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:real vs pseudo}. 
    When the inhomogeneity is introduced, where only the Dirac cone in the second region is tilted while the first region is vertical non-tilted. 
    The Fermi surfaces are partially overlapping as indicated by shaded area, which lead to asymmetric tunneling.

\section{Transmission under the influence of pseudo magnetic field}
    To illustrate how pseudo magnetic field affects the tunneling behaviors compared to their real counterpart,
    the transmissions under the effect of pseudo and real magnetic fields are plotted as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:pseudo}.
    First consider the case $U \gg E_F$, we found that when the tilted parameter is small, the transmission profiles between the two systems are almost identical, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pseudo1}, which confirms the existence of pseudo-MVP. 
    However, the pseudo-MVP is valid only if the strength of the tilt is small. 
    Otherwise, the transmission profiles would become distinguishable, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pseudo2}. 
    The same applies in the case of potential barrier $U=0$, where the pseudo-MVP occurs when $w_0$ is small and becomes weak as $w_0$ increase as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pseudo3}-\subref{fig:pseudo4}. 
    Besides, the effect of real magnetic vector potential destroys the Klein tunneling, since it shifts the whole Dirac cone in momentum space. 
    In contrast to pseudo magnetic vector potential, where momentum is also shifted but the position of Dirac point remains the same. 
    As a result, the Klein tunneling is still preserved.
